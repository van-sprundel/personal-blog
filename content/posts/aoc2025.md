## This year

This year I want to keep it simple since I don't have a lot of time to program, but I'll add a twist.

> Branchless Rust.

The idea is to keep the logic I write branchless, that means the for loop and some functions are still allowed to be branched, but any business logic should be either bit manipulation or be phased out. 

 I have a tendency to wonder why I'm even doing these coding challenges. The usual response is "to learn". Well, I could learn a new language, but I could also learn a new idiom. Branchless programming is usually relevant in embedded programming, and you often don't need to think about this when building e.g. a web app.

This, in my opinion, keeps the challenges unique enough that I don't get demotivated.
