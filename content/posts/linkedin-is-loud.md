I'm so tired of reading the same post 10x because everyone wants to be included.

What's hot right now is the CloudFlare outage. Everyone misses the actual issue which was that there were no (automated) tests/QA that were done to prevent this bug. Even a feature flag would've been sufficient so they could've seen the issue early-on.

This is what every LinkedIn poster does:

- Open ChatGPT
- "Rewrite this linkedin post about the cloudflare outage"
- _AI steers towards the use of `.unwrap()`_
- _LinkedIn man doesn't fact check anything or reads the post-mortem_

Result:
"Le unwrap is le dangerous. Here's how the unwrap works"

I'm so fucking tired. I don't care about your company, nor do I care about you. I don't care because YOU don't care either about what you post. You don't care about your career, only how it looks. In hindsight, this is the perfect representation of how LLM's function, so I'm not surprised managers are best friends with ChatGPT.

I'm not surprised corporate social media is lifeless, but I'm surprised no one actually cares. How do these people stay motivated to do anything. It can't just be money, right?

I added a disclaimer because I do feel like this post is very short-sighted. This feeling roots into the fact I'm tired of corporate hell, and these feelings resulted in me not being very productive at work. This also resulted in me being let go soon (also known as a PIP!).

You can skip this part if you don't care about my career.

When I started out at $COMPANY, it was mostly building tools with, from time to time, a manager doing a check-up. This worked amazingly, as I had time to learn and improve, and I was able to deliver.

Fast-forward a few months, we now have 3 managers, 1 dev (hi), and a buttload of busywork that needs to be done yesterday. From what I understand, a manager is supposed to be your safetynet and keep the context switching to a minimum. Tickets should feel like little updates, yet they take up 40% of my work (which could've been spent on solutioning). Since I'm the lead dev, any busywork will move tickets further back. This also means I'm to blame, because I should've been way earlier with alerting _them_ about the project's drift. I'M NOT A PM! It's my job to make the project and keep you up to date. If this isn't sufficient then go to the PM (oh wait, that's not me!). Another big issue I have with this workflow is that we're sometimes moving priorization mid-cycle due to client requests. This is fine if it wasn't low priority stuff a client _wants_ but doesn't _need_.

I get almost nothing done and I've grown tired of living in Linear. I wouldn't say I'm burnt-out. Similarly to an orgasm, you'd know if you had one. The company has turned into a startup with only the shortcomings and all of the corporate hell I wanted to avoid.

As I mentioned before, I'm being let go in January (as well as other people at the company). 2026 is going to start interestingly, but I think it would be free-ing. I still wish everyone at the company the best, because there are some smart and kind people I will miss.
