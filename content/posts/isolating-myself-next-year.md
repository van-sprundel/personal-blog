I don't enjoy tech anymore. Programming as a job doesn't excite me anymore. Personal projects only excite me, but they don't pay the bills.

I'm going to spend a few months away from all social media and the internet as a whole. I believe that the only reason I use these is out of habit and as an escape plan to not have to deal with my personal issues.

I'm getting angry about what GitHub has become, every day there's a new bug and QA just seems to be not existent. Apparently they've stopped shipping big features anyway.

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is slow, buggy, and [loud](/linkedin-is-loud). I don't see much benefit from using it other than the Daily Games :P

## Short-form content

Instagram Reels, TikTok, Youtube Shorts etc. only clog up my mind and make me unable to think. Instagram is the one I spend most my time on, but it's also broken as I'm writing this

## Staying in touch
If people really need to talk, they can call me. I don't believe that having 4G has made me more available.

## Job Interviews
I'm in the middle of tech interviews, I told these people to call me if they have any updates and to not contact me on LinkedIn. So far so good.

I'm pretty scared of getting a new job anyway, right now I'm not looking forward to a 40 hr work week. It doesn't seem healthy to be behind a screen >8 hrs a day, yet we normalized it. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I don't feel healthy at all. I would like a job that's at least partly in the real world.

## Closing note

The goal of this is to isolate myself from the internet as much as possible, this means I'm still able to do some things I enjoy like playing Guitar Hero or spend some time in a DAW or try to create something in Blender. I'm strictly blocking myself from programming, because I've been doing it actively since 2020 and I cannot really imagine a life without, which doesn't seem healthy.
