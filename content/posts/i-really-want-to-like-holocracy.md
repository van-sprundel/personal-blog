## The What if's

I want you to think about the following, if you were to choose how company management behaved, what would you change?

I'm going to list a few what if's. The goal is to have a critical argument for/against any of them. If you think any of these ideas are stupid, you're free to skip them. The goal is to find the most enjoyable work environment fit for you!

## What if... everyone earned the same?

We're all in this, and I don't see why one would earn less just because they're on a different team. Similarly, why is the boss taking the cake? Did he save the project?

I guess that also opens the question to: "Should you earn more if you did more" (spoiler, some companies do!). This does introducte competitiveness, and this might be bad if e.g. you have juniors walking around. Again, the goal is to open up the topic, not to give any yes/no answers.

## What if... you had no boss or manager to coordinate for you?

Not a single boss or manager, but instead everyone on the product team is responsible to communicate and coordinate properly. I bet you've already broken 1-2 company rules because it felt inefficient. Think like that, only you now have no rules to break, and you are the one making the rules.

Let's say you were a software dev without a manager to coordinate work. You coordinate yourself, and you communicate this with other software devs. That means you're in charge of choosing how you want to do this. This opens up a lot more doors. Will you be choosing the $100 / mth sticky node saas, or will you opt for a `TODOS.md`? Perhaps anything in between?

> You're telling me I now have time to actually develop instead of keeping my boss up to date?

Yes! and you won't get scoffed at either!

## What if... your team was a holacratic team?

Alright, we need to step back a little bit. For those of you who don't know, this refers to a ✨self-managing team✨. You're responsible for tapping your own shoulder.

The motivation for this topic was because I have been receiving negative feedback at work. This boils down to that my manager doesn't always know what I'm doing. This is understandable if I would be sitting on my ass all day, but I'm doing my very best to keep him up to date! I give him

- my linear activity (to show how much estimation im achieving!)
- my slack daily updates (to show how much work i get done in a day!)
- my harvest schedule (~~to show how much time i spent on each ticket!~~ to bill hours, and nothing else!)

Clearly this isn't enough, and I am a slob for not noticing this! I need to make a better effort at keeping him more informed, this way everything will be smooth sailing, and everyone will be doing their part 🫡.

On the topic of making yourself look important, this also adds an external dependency on your success. You now need to maintain that important status at work, and that might mean you lash out on your employees. If I remember correctly, managers are supposed to be your safety nets, not your bully.

> I wouldn't even call it a bully, because a bully wouldn't command another person to punch me instead of doing it himself. There's something ironic about a manager not doing his own work.

... moving back to holacracy.

There's not a lot of online conversations about this structure, and there's even less examples in the wild. My goal here is to figure out if this is even realistic, and why it succeeded/flopped.

### Case 1: Zappos

Zappos adopted Holacracy in 2014 to boost innovation and employee efficiency. 6 years later they abandoned the idea due to scalability challenges and system complexity.[^1]

However, 18% of Zappos employees took severance packages and left when holacracy was implemented.[^2] There's a lot of ways to interpret this. Basically 1 out of 5 people thought this was a bad idea. There's not enough info to figure out _why_ they left, and I have no idea how it was explained to them.

From the mentioned source I could at least conclude that there were two general reasons it flopped: Inefficiency and employee dissatisfaction.

Another study examined 20 companies that adopted Holacracy and found 60% reported improved employee engagement and innovation.[^3] These companies operated primarily in tech and creative sectors, which is really interesting.

> 70% reported improved job satisfaction from more autonomy, 25% felt overwhelmed by the lack of structure and reported increased stress levels  
> So basically: 1 in 4 people hated it.

### Case 2: 37signals - Probably the more famous "human-first" company

For those that don't know 37signals, they're pretty up-front about their culture and norms. This is pretty good on paper (compared to other companies)! I have no idea if they live up to it, but there are some definite sources.

Remember that equal pay rule? Basecamp has no negotiated salaries, because everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same, targeting the 90th percentile of San Francisco market rates regardless of where they live.[^4]

Sounds good so far! They're not holistic though, since they still have managers and a traditional hierarchy with five levels from junior to principal, and people are expected to progress (juniors reach senior in 4 years).

Nonetheless, I still think this is one of the best examples of how a company can be, because they're one of the more successful examples (both growth-wise and culture-wise).

### Case 3: Mondragon - The Big Worker Cooperative

This is the most laid out study of a holistic company, but also one of the more messier ones. The data is extremely contradictory and doesn't tell us anything, so I'll keep it relatively one-dimensional.

**The good**

Hypermarket stores with cooperative ownership grew sales significantly faster than non-cooperative stores.[^5] The cooperative has been around since 1956 and employed almost 100,000 people by 2008.

**The bad**

Between 1991 and 2007, the ratio of cooperative employment dropped from 86% to 29.5%[^6] because when they went international. This was basically their downfall. They created capitalist subsidiaries where foreign workers aren't owner-members. In global cooperatives where foreign employees outnumber Basque worker-members, there's no willingness to grant cooperative ownership to foreign employees because it would reduce profits for existing worker-members.[^7] Then, Fagor, one of their flagship cooperatives, completely collapsed in 2013 after becoming a multinational.

**Not a lot of ugly**

The highest-paid person can't make more than a certain multiple of the lowest-paid. That's all the info they shared, so I wouldn't say this counts as "equal pay for all".

Was this downfall their fault? To be honest, I have no idea. Overall it still seemed like there was someone making the actions, and they saw an opportunity to grab a buck. I wouldn't count this as a success, nor a failure.

### Case 4: Valve

I'll come in head-first, I really thought Valve was applying holacracy. While they're a "flat" company, they still have management.[^8] So even they do not see holacracy as a realistic way of functioning.

Valve has been "boss-free since 1996" with no management hierarchy, that much is true.

According to a People Make Games investigation based on interviews with current and former Valve employees, the workplace has been compared by two employees to "Lord of the Flies".[^9] Former Valve employee Jeri Ellsworth compared Valve's structure to "high school"—while all students are supposed to be equals, there are always popular kids who acquire power and lead, and the rest follow.[^10] One ex-employee described the company as having a "pseudo-flat structure" with a hidden layer of management hierarchy.[^11]

The flat structure resulted in many failed and abandoned projects, causing a general move away from software development toward more modular and less interdependent projects.[^12] The lack of organizational structure led to project cancellations because it was difficult to convince other employees to work on them, and Valve acknowledged in 2020 this made it difficult to gather momentum and slowed their output during the 2010s.[^13]

In 2023, People Make Games found that Valve's flat structure and stack-ranking compensation system created a poor release record and lack of employee diversity.[^13]

#### The Gabe Newell Factor

Here's the kicker about the "boss-less" claim: When the bossless model got in the way of Valve's direction, the change in strategy wasn't decided democratically by employees but was credited to founder and major shareholder Gabe Newell, who encouraged teams to pursue non-game projects like the Steam Deck.[^12]

> So it's "boss-less" except when the actual boss decides what everyone should work on.

#### Then I read about the salary

Pay for a particular employee is decided by the whole collective based on performance,[^14] but Valve uses a stack-ranking compensation system. People are literally ranked against each other, creating competition rather than collaboration. Does this introduce toxicity? Does it burn out people?

### Opening the valve

Valve is less proof that flat structures work, and more "proof that if you accidentally create a money-printing monopoly platform, you can afford to be dysfunctional." Gabe is openly critical about the model, saying it doesn't work at scale at all. In fact, this seemed to have created even more power hierarchies, just more informal now.

## Closing thoughts

There really isn't any. The goal of this note was to get more concrete example of holacracy in the wild. Turns out there's very little! And the ones that do exist either collapsed or pulled back. There seems to be no concrete formula.

What I do take from this is, fast-moving / creative industries _should_ avoid bureaucracy as much as possible. Unless you want to go global, apparently.

Even if you're in the right industry, it seems the most important part here is that a more experienced employee can help out the juniors, while **also** doing their own coordination. This requires a lot of expertise, and probably wouldn't work for a decent amount of employees.

I would still be curious if there are any small companies (<50 people) that have successfully implemented this, but it's hard to find any data. Either there's little info about the success rate or there's little info about the company itself.

## Sidenote

I really like reading Sean Goedecke's posts about his experience as a staff engineer. It's pretty insightful to see his experience, especially since he climbed the ladder. If you need a suggestion: https://www.seangoedecke.com/dangerous-advice/
