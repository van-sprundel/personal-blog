We shouldn't be putting hard requirements on job posts to wipe out job application. Just like we need a judge to check each court case. We're humans, and every case is different.

I totally get having requirements, but you cannot infer from a resume whether you would fit these requirements. 3+ YOE don't mean shit when your experience was working _alongside_ a technology.

I got rejected because I did not follow the following requirements:

### I do not have 3+ years of Node.js experience

I've been using Node.JS professionally for 2 years, but I've been using it for uni and hobby projects since 2019.

How do you know I'm good/bad at Node? You figure it out! In I have more than enough projects on my page that shows my usage of Node which goes further than just spinning up a basic server. I know my way around, and if my GitHub doesn't convince you I'm more than happy to show this during a 30 min call (but that's been cancelled, so we'll never know!).

### I have never worked with postgres

Again, i've been using this since 2019, and have done some professional work within $COMPANY that I would consider worth explaining in a meeting. This one doesn't even have a 3+ years requirement, the requiter just straight up missed this in my resume.

### I have never worked with graphql

Alright let's grab my [resume](/hire-me). If you don't want to, I'll help you out:

### I have never worked with Postgres

Again, I've been using

### I have never worked with AWS Lambda

I'll admit that this one isn't in there, so an AI might mark this as not done; But that's why I'm precisely advocating to not automatically deny someone this early.

I've professionally used Azure and have Kubernetes experience, if you think AWS Lambda is much harder than both of these, then sure, I don't tick this box.

## You do NOT need hard requirements

3+ years of experience tell you nothing. I know people with 2 YOE that work like rockstar devs. I also know people with 10 years of experience that have opted for vibe coding for greenfield (I'm not joking). See where the fallacy lies? and I don't even know that many software devs!
