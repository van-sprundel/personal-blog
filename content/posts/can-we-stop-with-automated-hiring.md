We shouldn't be automating hiring people, just like we shouldn't automate court cases; just like we shouldn't automate dating. We're humans, and every case is different. 

I totally get having requirements, but you cannot infer from a resume whether you would fit these requirements. 3+ YOE don't mean shit when your experience was working *alongside* a technology.

I got rejected because I did not follow the following requirements:

### I do not have 3+ years of Node.js experience

I've been using Node.JS professionally for 2 years, but I've been using it for uni and hobby projects since 2019. 

How do you know I'm good/bad at Node? You figure it out! In I have more than enough projects on my page that shows my usage of Node which goes further than just spinning up a basic server. I know my way around, and if my GitHub doesn't convince you I'm more than happy to show this during a 30 min call (but that's been cancelled, so we'll never know!).

### I have never worked with graphql

If you want, you can check my [resume](/hire-me). If you don't, I'll help you out:

###  I have never worked with AWS Lambda

I'll admit that this one isn't in there, so an AI might mark this as not done; But that's why I'm precisely advocating to not automate this.

I've professionally used Azure and have Kubernetes experience, if you think AWS Lambda is much harder than both of these, then sure, I don't tick this box.

## You do NOT need hard requirements

3+ years of experience tell you nothing. I know people with 2 YOE that work like rockstar devs. I also know people with 10 years of experience that have opted for vibe coding for greenfield (I'm not joking). See where the fallacy lies? and I don't even know that many software devs!
