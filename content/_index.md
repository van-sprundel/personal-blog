# Welcome!

Welcome to my blog. I’m Ramon, a systems programmer based in The Netherlands. 

I graduated in July 2024 from Avans with a degree in Computer Science.

Since then, I work as a Fullstack Developer. In my free time I like try to contribute to open-source projects.

If you notice a typo or error, please report it by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/van-sprundel/personal-blog/issues). Thank you.

# Things I value

## Open Source

I'm a big supporter for open-source. I contribute (and donated until GitHub screwed that over) when possible.

## New Tech

I care a lot about knowing what's out there, and which options we can work with. This means trying out new projects/tools that peak my interest.

Also good to note I'm biased towards the Rust and/or Go idiom. I like having more control, giving up some development speed. 

## A transparent feedback loop

I want to *know* someone else cares about the things I build. If I can't communicate with a customer, then I at least want a very transparent work environment. A lack of the latter makes it hard to figure out if I'm doing anything useful.

This usually involves over-communicating, something which I'm fine with. 

##  A work/life balance

I've had sleepless night from personal projects because I *wanted* to make good progress. Whether that's healthy is debatable.

That said, I also respect my personal time. I expect others to do so as well :P
